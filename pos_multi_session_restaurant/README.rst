========================
 Sync restaurant orders
========================

Syncs additional restaurant data:

* Table and floor
* Guests number
* Printer status (green "Order" button)
* Notes

Each multi-session and each unsynchronized POS may have its own floor set. POSes in multi-session have same floors.
